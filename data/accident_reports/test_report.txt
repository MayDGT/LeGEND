The crash occurred on an east/west urban interstate highway in the westbound lanes. There were three westbound travel lanes bordered on both sides by paved shoulders with rumble strips. The westbound lanes were separated from eastbound traffic by a concrete traffic wall. The roadway was straight with a downgrade that varied from 3-4% for the duration of the crash/pre-crash area. Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning with rush hour congestion approaching but not in a work zone. The speed limit was 89kph/55mph.Vehicle #1, a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer was traveling in the left westbound interstate lane when it encountered Vehicle #2, a 2003 Chevy Trailblazer also in the left lane decelerating for traffic congestion. Vehicle #1 on recognition of the situation began to brake and swerved right then came left almost immediately, striking Vehicle #2 on its right side. The impact caused Vehicle #2 to roll Â¼ turn to its left. As it skidded forward on its left side the roof of the vehicle came into contact with the barrier wall. The vehicle rode up the wall and was righted on to its wheels before crossing all three lanes of traffic and coming to rest on the right shoulder. After initial impact Vehicle #1 veered to its right crossing the center and right travel lanes. It was then struck in the rear by the front of Vehicle #3, a 1988 Chevy S10 pickup truck. Both V1 and V3 came to rest on the right shoulder. All three vehicles were towed due to damage.Vehicle #1 was driven by a 29-year old belted female whose airbags did not deploy in the crash. The driver stated that she was in the far left lane, headed into town and the car infront of her slammed on its brakes. Then she slammed on her brakes and the steering wheel jerked her to the right, then she fishtailed and hit her (V2) on her right side and she rolled into the wall. Then she swerved right and the other guy (V3) had no choice but to hit me when I went infront of him. We stopped on the right shoulder. EDR data indicated that the vehicle was traveling 75 MPH prior to brake activation. The driver of Vehicle #1 was uninjured in the crash.The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was: This vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This was coded because it had successfully avoided rear-ending V2 by swerving right initially. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a decision error: Too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others -speed limit 55MPH, highway congestion with good visibility, reference EDR data. The driver was not thought to have been fatigued, but does work a high stress sales job, was in the middle of an emotional relationship issue, and was also taking an over the counter sinus medication. The driver was wearing contacts that corrected a near-sighted condition. The driver was coded to have failed to look far enough ahead. Rush hour congestion was also coded as a contributing factor.Vehicle #2 was driven by a 23-year old belted female whose airbags did not deploy. She stated that shw was in the far left lane and the semi in fron of her began to slow down. She glanced up in her rear-view mirror and saw the red trailblazer (V1) swerve and hit her. She would have had plenty of room to stop. then she fell over on the drivers door and her truck ran into the wall and was lifted back up onto its wheels until she stopped. She sustained non-incapacitating injuries in the crash. She was not transported to a hospital for treatment.The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #2 was: Other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. An associated factor -family problem was coded to this driver as her child has been in ICU for three months and this had been weighing on her mind. Rush hour congestion was also coded as an associated factor. This driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash.Vehicle #3 was driven by a 20-year old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He stated that he was in the far right hand lane. the traffice was jammed up ahead and all lanes were slowing down. He said that the Red SUV hit ist brakes too late and hit the other vehicle (V2) and then it went out of control. V2 rolled back on it wheels, then the red SUV looked like it was trying to get onto the grass (right side of the interstate). The right corner of V3 hit the back of the red SUV.The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #3 was not involved in first harmful event. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. This driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
